## Introduction
**wozu** is a plugin in the form of a server decorator and an additional util to list all defined routes of your [hapi.js](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) server instance. Just call the server method and get a list of all endpoints including paths and methods.<br>
*wozu* is the German translation for *wherefore* - it was implemented as an util related to the plugin [wo](https://github.com/rjrodger/wo).

The modules `standard` and `ava` are used to grant a high quality implementation.<br>
This major release supports just [hapi.js](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) `>=v16.0.0` and node `>=v8.0.0` https://github.com/felixheck/wozu/tree/release/2.0.0 â€” to support older versions please use `v1.1.1`.

## Installation
For installation use the [Node Package Manager](https://github.com/npm/npm):
```
$ npm install --save wozu
```

or clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/felixheck/wozu
```

## Usage
#### Import
First you have to import the module:
``` js
const wozu = require('wozu');
```

#### Create hapi server
Afterwards create your hapi server and the corresponding connection if not already done:
``` js
const hapi = require('hapi');

const server = hapi.server({
  port: 8888,
  host: 'localhost',
});
```

Additionally register all your routes.

#### Registration
Finally register the plugin per `server.register()`:
``` js
await server.register(wozu);
```

After registering `wozu`, the [hapi server object](https://hapijs.com/api#server) will be decorated with the new method `server.wozu()`.<br>
It is not allowed to register `wozu` twice.

#### Usage
Use the plugin/util in the required context. For example during the registration of `wo`:

``` js
await server.register({
  register: require('wo'),
  options: {
    bases,
    route: server.wozu(),
    sneeze: {
      silent: true
    }
  }
})
```

The method returns a sorted and unified list of all defined routes.<br>

## Usage as Util
This package include besides the plugin a corresponding util feature, so it is not necessary to use `wozu` as a plugin:

``` js
const wozu = require('wozu');
const hapi = require('hapi');

const server = hapi.server({
  port: 8888,
  host: 'localhost',
});

async function init() {
  await server.register({
    register: require('wo'),
    options: {
      bases,
      route: wozu.list(server),
      sneeze: {
        silent: true
      }
    }
  })
}

init();
```

## API
`wozu.list(server, [host])`

- `server {Object}` - the corresponding [hapi server object](https://hapijs.com/api#server).
- `host {string}` - the host to filter routes matching a specific virtual host.

`server.wozu([host])`

- `host {string}` - the host to filter routes matching a specific virtual host.


## Developing and Testing
First you have to install all dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

To execute all unit tests once, use:
```
$ npm test
```

or to run tests based on file watcher, use:
```
$ npm start
```

To get information about the test coverage, use:
```
$ npm run coverage
```
